# Employer Database

This is a research project on employees of Pewlett Hackward from the 1980s and 1990s. The database contains six CVS files pertaining to the employees' information such as their salaries employee numbers, etc... The objective is to use SQL to query data and answer questions about the employees. 

### Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.

### Data Engineering
Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
