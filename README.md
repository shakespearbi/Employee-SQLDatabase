# Employer Database

This is a research project on employees of Pewlett Hackward from the 1980s and 1990s. The database contains six CVS files pertaining to the employees' information such as their salaries employee numbers, etc... The objective is to use SQL to query data and answer questions about the employees. 

### Data Modeling
An ERD of the tables was sketched out using a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com after inspecting the CSV files, . The diagram is shown below. 

### Data Engineering
Using the ERD as referrence, a table schema was created for each of the six CSV files. Every table specified the appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints and each CSV file was imported into the corrensponding SQL table.
